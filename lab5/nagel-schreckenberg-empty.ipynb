    "Nagel–Schreckenberg  is a simple model used for modelling motorway traffic. As the name suggest, it was developed by two German physicists Kai Nagel and Michael Schreckenberg in the early 1990s.\n",
    "## Road\n",
    "The road is divided into cells. Each cell represents a part of the road. A cell can be either empty or contains a single car (only one car in any cell).\n",
    "## Car \n",
    "Cars are one cell long and have a velocity $v$, originally in range of 0-5 units per time unit.\n",
    "## Transisition rules\n",
    "In the transition function the following steps are performed (mind the order):\n",
    "* **Acceleration**: The velocity of all cars having a velocity lower than the maximum velocity is increased by 1.\n",
    "* **Slowing down**: If the distance between the current and the following car is smaller than the car's velocity, the velocity is reduced to the number of empty cells in front of the car (avoiding collisions).\n",
    "* **Randomization**: The speed of all cars that have a $v > 1$ is reduced by one unit with the probability of *p*. \n",
    "* **Car motion**: All cars are moved *v* cells ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Discretisation of time and space results in cellular automata. If the maximum speed is equal to 1, the model is identical to elementary cellular automaton with rule 184. \n",
