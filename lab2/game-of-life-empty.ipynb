    "A Cellular Automata (abbreviated CA) is a **discrete, abstract computational system** ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philospohy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cellular-automata/)) used in various areas of science. Cellular Automata can simulate a wide range of processes in biology, chemistry etc. CA was invented by John von Neumann and Stanisław Ulam in the 1940s. A well-known specialist in CAs is Stephen Wolfram — creator of *Mathematica* and founder of *WolframAlpha*.\n",
