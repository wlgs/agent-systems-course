    "Today you'll create a more complex simulation of crowd dynamics. We are trying to model the movement of people trying to leave a room (e.g. lectureroom, stadium etc.). The room has one or more exit and people insidie want to leave it using the closest exit. The model uses static field which can be treated as a *distance* to the closest exit. Agents move toward the exits by choosing the cells with the smallest value of static field in their neighbourhoods. Static field is also used to simulate walls (wall is a cell with ridiculously high static field value, so no agent will choose it).\n",
